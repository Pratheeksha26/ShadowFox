## Task 1
Develop an autocorrect keyboard system that anticipates the next word in a sentence by leveraging the contextual information provided by preceding words. This task involves the implementation of ngrams or recurrent neural networks to enhance predictive capabilities. The goal is to create an intuitive keyboard that improves user experience by accurately anticipating and suggesting the next word, thereby facilitating efficient and errorfree text input.

## Task 2
Your task is to develop an ML model for car selling price prediction and analysis. The deployed system will provide users with an approximate selling price for their cars based on several features, including fuel type, years of service, showroom price, number of previous owners, kilometers driven, whether the seller is a dealer or an individual, and transmission type (manual/automatic).
